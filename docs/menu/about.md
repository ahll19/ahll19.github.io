I'm Anders Lauridsen, a masters' student at Aalborg University in Denmark. I am studying for a degree in Mathematical Engineering. You can download my CV [here](/404.html)

# My work

A Mathematical Engineering master's program combines advanced mathematical principles with engineering applications. I've gained a strong mathematical foundation and learned to apply these skills to solve real-world engineering challenges. The program encompasses courses in mathematics, computational methods, and research projects, preparing graduates for careers at the intersection of mathematics and engineering.

During my Bachelors, and at the start of my masters, I worked as a teaching assistant, helping out in courses like calculus, linear algebra, and statistics.

Since I began my master's I have worked as a student data scientist at [APX10](https://apx10.com/). Here I have been creating tools in Python to help water and wastewater utilities understand their data better.

I spent my 9th semester as an intern at the micro electronics section of the [EP-ESE](https://ep-ese.web.cern.ch/) group at [CERN](https://home.cern/). I work specifically in one of the many RnD working groups in this section, specifically focusing on creating a tool to make it easier to design radiation tolerant SoCs. My work has focused on creating data analysis tools to help understand how a given SoC performs, and doing work on modelling upset rates due to radiation, in these SoCs. During this stay I've had the pleasure of being under the supervision of [Alessandro Caratelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caratelli/).

# My skills

## Mathematics
My passion for mathematics drives my academic pursuits. My master's program has a strong mathematical focus, distinguishing it from other engineering degrees. I'm enthusiastic about exploring diverse real-world applications of mathematics. 

## Programming
I have not had formal training in programming, but I am very proficient in Python. I enjoy tinkering with other languages, especially Rust, and learning more about what is possible with modern programming tools such as Docker. I am adept object-oriented-programming, learn quickly when it comes to technical subjects.

## Linux
I have used Linux on my laptop, and switched between it and Windows on my desktop, for many years now. I enjoy tinkering and customizing my environment, so Linux ended up being a perfect fit.

# My interests
I have had many hobbies and done many sports throughout the years. Some of my main interests are
- Cooking
- Photography
- Dungeons and Dragons
- Messing around with spare computers to do home-automation or set up other servers. 

I enjoy learning about new things, everything from mathematics, physics, music theory, linguistics, and whatever else short documentaries pop up on my YouTube-feed. I am not afraid of diving in to new technical topics which are new to me, and I don't get much enjoyment work that is too easy.
