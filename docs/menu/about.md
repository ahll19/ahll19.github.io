I'm Anders Lauridsen, a masters' student at Aalborg University in Denmark.

My interests include, but are not limited to, cooking, mathematics, physics, music, video game design, and photography. Like so many other people I have had a lot of hobbies, most of them abandoned. I have also worked on quite a few different projects in my spare-time, often including computers and perhaps a bit of programming. 

This blog is a way for me to write down projects that I have worked on and found interesting, and share it with other people. Who knows, maybe I will create something that proves to be useful for someone at some point.

Feel free to contact me using any of the links in the top right corner of all pages on this site, or subscribe using RSS as if the current year was 2005.
