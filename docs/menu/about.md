I'm Anders Lauridsen, I have a master's degree in mathematical engineering from Aalborg University and an unhealthy habbit of starting too many projects.

This blog is a way for me to write down projects that I have worked on and found interesting, and share it with other people. Who knows, maybe I will create something that proves to be useful for someone at some point.

Feel free to contact me using any of the links in the top right corner of all pages on this site, or subscribe using RSS as if the current year was 2005.
