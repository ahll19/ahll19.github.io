**Todo**
1. Make schematic of speaker internals
   1. [Cement resistors](https://www.bennic.com.tw/catalogue/en/Resistors-en.pdf) (white boxy things) 
   2. [film capacitor](https://frequence.dk/hifi/424-bennic-capacitors/6728-bennic-mt-10-microf-100v-5/) (not this exact one but something close)
   3. Perhaps the copper coils are inductors? Check out my reddit post I guess.
2. Add link to speaker brochure, probably through internet archive or something
3. Run Snapcast on home-server and a few old android phones

*Some fancy introduction to the post. Probably touch on*
1. *cost of speakers*
2. *some Sonos shenanigans*
