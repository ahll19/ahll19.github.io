# Speaker

**Todo**
1. Make schematic of speaker internals
   1. [Cement resistors](https://www.bennic.com.tw/catalogue/en/Resistors-en.pdf) (white boxy things) 
   2. [film capacitor](https://frequence.dk/hifi/424-bennic-capacitors/6728-bennic-mt-10-microf-100v-5/) (not this exact one but something close)
   3. Perhaps the copper coils are inductors? Check out my reddit post I guess.
2. Add link to speaker brochure, probably through internet archive or something

## Wiring
Extremely difficult to find information on caps and coils

# Software
[snapcast inspiration and guide](https://whynot.guide/posts/howtos/multiroom-media/)
- Pi5 running snapcast server 
- pi3a+ running snapcast client
- Dell workstation running Home Assistant in docker

## Set up HACS in Home Assistant

## Install and configure Snapcast
