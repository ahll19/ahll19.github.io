**Todo**
1. Make schematic of speaker internals
2. Add link to speaker brochure, probably through internet archive or something
3. Lock onto a plan:
   1. Make a smart speaker using raspotify on a Zero w 2, along with maybe using google cast
   2. Make a dumb speaker using AUX and just use the holes in the speaker for adding this entry
   3. Make some other plan...
