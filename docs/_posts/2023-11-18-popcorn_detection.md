# 1. Introduction
My hope is that one day this blog will be filled with overengineered solutions to problems that either don't exist, or are or of so little concern that they aren't worth the effort of solving.

One such non-problem is knowing when microwave popcorn are done popping. I had the idea when I had some friends over for a visit, and we wanted popcorn. I didn't want to leave the conversation, but I didn't want to leave the conversation. And while waiting for the popcorn to pop I started to wonder how one might automate the process of determining the doneness of microwave popcorn. This post is part of that process.
